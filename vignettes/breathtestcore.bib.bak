  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to develop a breath test for measuring gastric emptying rate of solids that would induce less radiation exposure than radioscintigraphy and would be applicable to field testing. METHODS: A test meal was used in which [14C]-octanoic acid was mixed with egg yolk and prepared as a scrambled egg. The test meal was labeled with a second marker, 99mTc-albumin colloid, and simultaneous radioscintigraphic and breath test measurements were performed in 36 subjects, 16 normal controls, and 20 patients with dyspeptic symptoms. Mathematical analysis of the excretion rate of labeled CO2 resulted in the definition of three parameters, i.e., gastric emptying coefficient, gastric half-emptying time, and lag phase. RESULTS: There was an excellent correlation between the gastric emptying coefficient and the scintigraphic half-emptying time (r = -0.88); between the half-emptying time determined by the breath test and the scintigraphic half-emptying time (r = 0.89); and between the lag phases determined by scintigraphy and those determined by breath test (r = 0.92). 14C can be replaced by 13C for labeling the octanoic acid used in the breath test. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the octanoic acid breath test is a reliable noninvasive test to measure gastric emptying rate of solids.},

  abstract      = {The (13)C-octanoic acid breath test is a convenient method for assessing gastric emptying (GE). Success depends on obtaining a well-characterized time profile of the excretion of label in breath, which may not be the case if GE is delayed.To use Bayesian techniques in conjunction with hierarchical modelling as a method to increase the success of the modelling process.Retrospective analysis of 164 individual breath tests using the WinBUGS program. The approach was tested by analysing the complete dataset simultaneously, and also as individual studies.The time required for Bayesian modelling was comparable with that needed for the usual methods. The results obtained were almost identical to those obtained from conventional modelling for well-behaved breath tests, but much more realistic in cases where the experimental data was poor, or when GE was delayed.The use of Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the (13)C-octanoic acid breath test is demonstrated. By adopting a hierarchical model, realistic values for the lag phase and half-emptying time were obtained in situations when conventional parameter estimation failed. This is particularly relevant when GE is unexpectedly delayed. We recommend that WinBUGS become the method of choice for analysing breath test data.},

  abstract      = {The (13)C-octanoate breath test has not achieved universal acceptance for the measurement of solid phase gastric emptying, largely because the results are not comparable with those from direct methods such as scintigraphy. To convert breath-test data to their scintigraphic equivalent scale corrections are applied which have been obtained from population studies, but there is no guarantee that these are applicable in all cases. We propose an alternative method applicable on an individual basis based upon a simple physiological model which does not require any change to the breath-test protocol. It is demonstrated by comparison with scintigraphy and the octanoate saliva test. Results from an existing dataset of simultaneous breath test, saliva test and scintigraphic determinations of solid phase gastric emptying from nine healthy subjects were re-analysed. The corrected breath tests gave gastric emptying curves which were shown to be not significantly different to those obtained from scintigraphy. The method provides a simple but effective way of generating gastric emptying curves from breath-test data that are directly comparable with direct measurement methods, which is advantageous since it allows the whole of the gastric emptying profile to be generated, not just values for the lag phase and half-emptying times.},
