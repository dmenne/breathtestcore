  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to develop a breath test for measuring gastric emptying rate of solids that would induce less radiation exposure than radioscintigraphy and would be applicable to field testing. METHODS: A test meal was used in which [14C]-octanoic acid was mixed with egg yolk and prepared as a scrambled egg. The test meal was labeled with a second marker, 99mTc-albumin colloid, and simultaneous radioscintigraphic and breath test measurements were performed in 36 subjects, 16 normal controls, and 20 patients with dyspeptic symptoms. Mathematical analysis of the excretion rate of labeled CO2 resulted in the definition of three parameters, i.e., gastric emptying coefficient, gastric half-emptying time, and lag phase. RESULTS: There was an excellent correlation between the gastric emptying coefficient and the scintigraphic half-emptying time (r = -0.88); between the half-emptying time determined by the breath test and the scintigraphic half-emptying time (r = 0.89); and between the lag phases determined by scintigraphy and those determined by breath test (r = 0.92). 14C can be replaced by 13C for labeling the octanoic acid used in the breath test. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the octanoic acid breath test is a reliable noninvasive test to measure gastric emptying rate of solids.},

  abstract      = {The (13)C-octanoate breath test has not achieved universal acceptance for the measurement of solid phase gastric emptying, largely because the results are not comparable with those from direct methods such as scintigraphy. To convert breath-test data to their scintigraphic equivalent scale corrections are applied which have been obtained from population studies, but there is no guarantee that these are applicable in all cases. We propose an alternative method applicable on an individual basis based upon a simple physiological model which does not require any change to the breath-test protocol. It is demonstrated by comparison with scintigraphy and the octanoate saliva test. Results from an existing dataset of simultaneous breath test, saliva test and scintigraphic determinations of solid phase gastric emptying from nine healthy subjects were re-analysed. The corrected breath tests gave gastric emptying curves which were shown to be not significantly different to those obtained from scintigraphy. The method provides a simple but effective way of generating gastric emptying curves from breath-test data that are directly comparable with direct measurement methods, which is advantageous since it allows the whole of the gastric emptying profile to be generated, not just values for the lag phase and half-emptying times.},

Success depends on obtaining a well-characterized time profile of the excretion of label in breath, which may not be the case if GE is delayed. To use Bayesian techniques in conjunction with hierarchical modelling as a method to increase the success of the modelling process. Retrospective analysis of 164 individual breath tests using the WinBUGS program. The approach was tested by analysing the complete dataset simultaneously, and also as individual studies. The time required for Bayesian modelling was comparable with that needed for the usual methods. The results obtained were almost identical to those obtained from conventional modelling for well-behaved breath tests, but much more realistic in cases where the experimental data was poor, or when GE was delayed. The use of Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the (13)C-octanoic acid breath test is demonstrated. By adopting a hierarchical model, realistic values for the lag phase and half-emptying time were obtained in situations when conventional parameter estimation failed. This is particularly relevant when GE is unexpectedly delayed. We recommend that WinBUGS become the method of choice for analysing breath test data.},

Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science (January 1, 1966 to December 15, 2006) for randomized controlled trials of 5-HT(3) antagonists in IBS reporting clinical end points of the IBS symptom complex and safety parameters. Study characteristics, markers of methodologic quality, and outcomes for the intention-to-treat population for each randomized controlled trial were extracted independently. We found 14 eligible randomized controlled trials of alosetron (n = 3024) or cilansetron (n = 1116) versus placebo (n = 3043) or mebeverine (n = 304). Random-effects meta-analyses found 5-HT(3) antagonists more effective than the comparators in achieving global improvement in IBS symptoms (pooled relative risk, 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-1.72; I(2) = 0%) and relief of abdominal pain and discomfort (pooled relative risk, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.22-1.39; I(2) = 22%). Benefit was apparent for both agents, in patients of either sex. These agents were more likely to cause constipation (pooled relative risk, 4.28; 95% CI, 3.28-5.60, I(2) = 65%); there was less constipation with 5-HT(3) antagonists in D-IBS patients than in mixed populations (NC-IBS and D-IBS; relative risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41-0.99). Nine patients (0.2%) using 5-HT(3) antagonists had possible ischemic colitis versus none in control groups. 5-HT(3) antagonists significantly improve symptoms of NC-IBS or D-IBS in men and women. There is an increased risk of constipation with 5-HT(3) antagonists, although the risk is lower in those with D-IBS.},

Our aims were (i) to test the effects of patient characteristics and of diseases that may impair 13C-OA-metabolism on GE parameters. (ii) To compare different GE endpoints. Therefore, we investigated effects of age, gender, BMI and diseases with potential impact on 13C-OA-metabolism (including pancreatic, liver and lung disease, diabetes, IBD) on cumulative 4h-13CO2-excretion (4h-CUM) and T1/2 calculated by non-linear regression model (NL, determined by shape of breath test curve) and generalized linear regression model (GLR, reflects absolute 13CO2-excretion) in 1279 patients and 19 healthy controls who underwent a standardized 13C-OA-breath test. Digestive and metabolic disturbances hardly influenced 4h-CUM or T1/2 calculated by NL or GLR models. In the multivariate linear regression models, 4h-CUM was significantly predicted by diabetes adjusted for age, gender and IBD but influence of these parameters was small (R2 = 0.028, P < 0.0001). T1/2(NL) and 4h-CUM were weakly correlated, even after exclusion of tests with unrealistically high estimates for T1/2(NL) (n = 1095, R(2) = 0.029, P < 0.0001). Conversely, 4h-CUM was closely associated with T(1/2)(GLR) (exponential correlation, R(2) = 0.774, P < 0.00001, n = 1279). We conclude that influences of digestive and metabolic disturbances on 13CO2-excretion following 13C-OA-application are generally low. Thus, our findings resolve an important criticism of methods using absolute 13CO2-excretion for evaluation of 13C-OA-breath tests and suggest that such models may correctly identify T1/2 in a mixed patient population.},

A stable isotope (13C) breath test attempts to estimate the rate of absorption of 13C, as an index of gastric emptying rate, from the rate of pulmonary elimination of 13CO2. The time-gastric emptying curve determined by the breath test is quite different from that determined by scintigraphy or ultrasonography. In this report, we have shown that the W-N method can adjust the difference. The W-N equation to estimate gastric emptying from breath data is as follows: the fractional cumulative amount of gastric contents emptied by time t = Abreath (t)/Abreath (infinity) + (1/0.65).d[Abreath (t)/Abreath (infinity) ]/dt, where Abreath (t) = the cumulative recovery of 13CO2 in breath by time t and Abreath ( infinity ) = the ultimate cumulative 13CO2 recovery. The emptying flow curve generated by ultrasonography was compared with that generated by the W-N method-adjusted breath test in 6 volunteers. The emptying curves by the W-N method were almost identical to those by ultrasound. The W-N method can generate an accurate emptying flow curve from 13CO2 data, and it can adjust the difference between ultrasonography and the breath test.},
