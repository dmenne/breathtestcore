\title{Lag phase for Bluck-Coward self-correcting fit}
\usage{
tlag_bluck_coward(cf)
}
\arguments{
\item{cf}{named vector of coefficients; only \code{k} and \code{beta} are required.
Note that in this package,  \code{k} is measured in 1/min (e.g. 0.01/min),
while in the literature is is often quoted as 1/h (e.g. 0.6/h).}
}
\value{
Lag phase in minutes (time t at which the maximum in the rate of change
of g(t) occurs)
}
\description{
This parameter is probably not very useful, as it can be negative
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{exp_beta}}, and \code{\link{t50_bluck_coward}} for an example.
