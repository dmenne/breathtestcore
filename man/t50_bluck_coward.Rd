\title{Bluck-Coward self-corrected half-emptying time}
\usage{
t50_bluck_coward(cf)
}
\arguments{
\item{cf}{Named vector of coefficients; only \code{k} and \code{beta} are required.
In this package, \code{k} is measured in units of 1/min (e.g. 0.01/min),
in publications it is often quoted as 1/h (e.g. 0.6/h).}
}
\value{
Time where value is 1/2 of the maximum, i.e. t_{50} or t_{1/2} in minutes; 
in the publication by Bluck et al, the parameter is called t_{1/2(in)}.
}
\description{
Uses Newton's method to solve the self-corrected Bluck-Coward equation
for 1/2 to compute the half-emptying time t_50.

test for gastric emptying. Digestion 83_96-107, page 98.

\examples{
# From table 3 and 4 in Bluck et al.; values for \\code{k} and \\code{beta} 
# (nls, bayesian) are entered and checked against the tabulated values of 
# t_{1/2(in)}.
# Most errors are small, but there are some outliers; errors in paper table?
# Parameters and Bluck et al. results:
