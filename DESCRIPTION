Description: Reads several formats of 13C data (IRIS/Wagner, BreathID) and CSV.
        Creates artificial sample data for testing. 
        Fits Maes/Ghoos, Bluck-Coward self-correcting formula using nls, nlme and
        Stan, and Wagner-Nelson with k(el) estimated from parametric fit.

        by the C-13-octanoate breath test --- rationalization with
        scintigraphy Physiol. Meas. 27 279-89. 
        This package contains a refactored subset of dmenne/d13cbreath without 
        database and display functions. Methods to fit breath test curves
        with Bayesian Stan methods are exported to package dmenne/breatteststan.
