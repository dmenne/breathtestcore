        Creates artificial sample data for testing. 
        Fits Maes/Ghoos, Bluck-Coward self-correcting formula using 'nls', 'nlme'.
        Methods to fit breath test curves with Bayesian Stan methods are refactored to 
        package 'breathteststan'. For a Shiny GUI, see package 
        'dmenne/breathtestshiny' on github.
